notes:

- consider this a rough prototype to demonstrate design only
- this framework is aiming to implement a "GOF" style MVC pattern
- the EventStream is inspired by node.js's EventEmitter with following differences: 
	1) events are queued 
	2) listeners added while notifications do not get the current notification
- all client side assets and code (except for the GUIFramework.html) are is in the public directory
- the code inside node_modules is intended to be shared by client and server (if that model applies)
- very rough and brute force framwork tests inplace (requires node.js)
- run test by command line: "node test.js"
- current loading of localized strings is a major bottleneck
- the string files should probably be JSON files
- seems to be working for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari (Mac OSX)

todo: 
- remove constants littering the code 
- document 
- more unit and recursion tests
